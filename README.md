# Bayesian-Variable-Selection
This repository contains the matlab code for Bayesian variable selection as described in George, E.I. and McCulloch, R.E., 1993. The
algorithm is implemented on a simulated example.
project_simulation.m -> We have developed a gibbs sampling algorithm that can do feature selection on the simulated data set.
